C. The molecule is an acyclic monophosphate nucleotide analog of deoxycytidine with antiviral properties, primarily used against cytomegalovirus (CMV). Inside the host cell, cidofovir is transformed into its active form, cidofovir diphosphate, through phosphorylation by cellular enzymes. This active metabolite mimics natural nucleotides, allowing it to compete with deoxycytosine-5-triphosphate for incorporation by viral DNA polymerase into the viral DNA. This incorporation disrupts DNA polymerization and halts virus replication. A. The molecule is a volatile, aromatic, triphosphate purine analog of guanosine with analgesic properties, and predominantly used against influenza viruses. After incorporation into the host cell, cidofovir is degraded by proteases to its active metabolite cidofovir diphosphate. Cidofovir diphosphate, mismatching the structural requirements of nucleotides, competes with guanosine-5'-diphosphate (GDP) for viral DNA polymerase, resulting in nonspecific binding to proteins and interferes with the host cell's protein synthesis. B. The molecule is an inorganic, polymeric, triphosphate ribonucleotide analog of thymidine with antibacterial activity, and extensively used against varicella-zoster virus (VZV). After incorporation into the host cell, cidofovir is dephosphorylated by nucleotidases to its inactive metabolite cidofovir monophosphate. Cidofovir monophosphate, lacking any structural resemblance to nucleotides, fails to interact with deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphate (dTTP) for viral DNA polymerase and is unable to be incorporated into the viral DNA, therefore it has no effect on DNA replication of viruses. D. The molecule is a stable, cyclic, diphosphate nucleoside analog of adenosine with antifungal activity, and commonly used against herpes simplex virus (HSV). After incorporation into the host cell, cidofovir is phosphorylated by hexokinase to its active metabolite cidofovir triphosphate. Cidofovir triphosphate, bearing structural similarity to nucleosides, competes with adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP) for viral RNA polymerase and gets incorporated into the growing RNA strands. As a result, it enhances further RNA synthesis and supports RNA replication of viruses."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "C"}]}

D. The molecule is a carbamate pesticide, a class of chemicals derived from carbamic acid, which functions similarly to organophosphate insecticides and is utilized in residential, gardening, and agricultural contexts. Introduced in 1956, carbaryl became the most extensively used carbamate worldwide, favored for its low mammalian oral and dermal toxicity and effectiveness against a broad range of pests. It is particularly popular for use in lawns and gardens. Carbamates generally possess high toxicity to Hymenoptera, such as bees and wasps, necessitating careful application to avoid harming these beneficial insects. Some carbamates can be absorbed and transported within plants, making them suitable for systemic applications. The molecule in question is also a component found in cigarettes. A. The molecule is a typical monosaccharide sugar. Monosaccharides are the simplest form of carbohydrates and serve as energy sources and as building blocks for nucleic acids. They are usually white crystalline solids that have a sweet taste and are soluble in water. The functional groups present, such as hydroxyls, contribute to their solubility and reactivity, participating in glycosidic bonds to form complex carbohydrates and providing the energy necessary for cellular metabolism. Monosaccharides play pivotal roles in the cellular processes of living organisms, particularly in energy production and storage. B. The molecule is a conventional plasticizer. Plasticizers are additives that increase the plasticity or fluidity of the material to which they are added, including plastics, concrete, wallboard and clay. They are typically phthalate esters that give plastic products such as PVC the desired flexibility and durability. The compound's ester functional group interacts with the polymer chains to space them apart, which in turn provides the materials with desirable properties for industrial and consumer use, such as flexibility, transparency, and longevity. C. The molecule is a simple aromatic ester. Aromatic esters are characterized by their fragrant properties and are commonly used in the production of perfumes and flavorings. They often possess a pleasant scent and are sometimes found in essential oils and pheromones. The presence of the benzene ring in their structure contributes to their stability and high boiling points, making them suitable for use in fragrances that need a long-lasting scent. Due to their aromatic nature, they are frequently used in the cosmetic industry to enhance the aroma of various beauty products."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "D"}]}

A. The molecule is a selective inhibitor of the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11b-HSD1), which is associated with various metabolic effects. AZD4017, by inhibiting 11b-HSD1, blocks the conversion of cortisone to cortisol, a hormone that activates glucocorticoid receptors. This action potentially mitigates glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, systolic hypertension, increased adiposity, myoatrophy, and dermal atrophy associated with the excessive production of cortisol in metabolic tissues where 11b-HSD1 is abundant, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Furthermore, AZD4017 does not affect the anti-inflammatory activity of glucocorticoids. B. The molecule is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent that targets the synthesis of fungal cell walls. Upon administration, AZD4017 selectively binds to and inhibits the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase. This interrupts the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane, leading to fungal cell death. By disrupting ergosterol synthesis in fungi, AZD4017 may treat a wide range of fungal infections, including candidiasis and aspergillosis. Lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that is critical to the fungal cell wall biosynthesis pathway. It is highly conserved among various fungal species. AZD4017 does not affect cholesterol synthesis in human cells, which is also reliant on a similar demethylation process. C. The molecule is a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, used in the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms. Upon administration, AZD4017 selectively binds to and blocks the action of muscarinic receptors. This decreases involuntary bladder contractions and increases bladder capacity, which improves symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence. By inhibiting muscarinic activity in bladder smooth muscle, AZD4017 may help to restore normal bladder function. Muscarinic receptors are predominantly located in the parasympathetic nervous system and regulate various involuntary body functions. They modulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretions, and heart rate. AZD4017 does not inhibit the sympathetic nervous system activity that mediates the fight-or-flight response. D. The molecule is a potent, selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), with strong anti-inflammatory properties. Upon administration, AZD4017 selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of COX-2. This reduces the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, thereby alleviating pain, fever, and inflammation. By targeting COX-2 in immune cells, AZD4017 may reduce the occurrence of the adverse effects typically associated with nonselective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as gastrointestinal bleeding. COX-2 is primarily expressed in sites of inflammation. It plays a significant role in mediating inflammatory responses and is responsible for the synthesis of prostanoids. AZD4017 does not affect COX-1 activity, which is important for gastrointestinal tract protection and platelet aggregation."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "A"}]}

Chromium in its +6 oxidation state (chromium(VI)) is considered stable and safe for consumption in small quantities. Trivalent chromium (chromium(III)), which is more prevalent in nature, is responsible for a majority of skin allergies. D. The molecule is an organometallic compound of chromium. It is primarily used in the polymerization of ethylene to produce large-volume plastic products. Chromium is a chemical element which has the symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It is commonly extracted from the seawater, through an evaporation process, and is predominantly used as a nutritional supplement. Chromium is least reactive in its +6 oxidation state (chromium(VI)) and is often added to steel to reduce corrosion. Trivalent chromium (chromium(III)) on the other hand, is a harmful pollutant emerging from industrial waste."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "B"}]}
